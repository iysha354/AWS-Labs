Hands on AWS re/start Labs. Beginner level for Cloud engineering/ devops

# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS re/Start Core Infrastructure & Automation Labs

This repository documents practical AWS labs completed during the **AWS re/Start** program, focused on deploying and managing cloud infrastructure, automating workflows, and monitoring system health. The labs simulate real-world tasks related to **infrastructure provisioning**, **automation**, **scaling**, **serverless architecture**, **storage**, and **monitoring** ‚Äî key skills for modern **Cloud Support** and **DevOps** roles.

## ‚úÖ Skills Demonstrated

### AWS CLI & Systems Manager
- Installed and configured the **AWS CLI** for local and remote resource management.
- Used **AWS Systems Manager** to:
  - Connect to EC2 instances securely without SSH keys
  - Run commands at scale across managed instances

### EC2 & Instance Management
- Launched and configured **Amazon EC2** instances (Linux & Windows).
- Performed **troubleshooting** on instance startup failures.
- Participated in an **EC2 configuration challenge** to solidify setup skills.

### S3 & Static Website Hosting
- Created and configured **Amazon S3 buckets** for object storage.
- Deployed a **static website** using S3 with public access settings.
- Managed permissions, versioning, and lifecycle rules.
- Completed **S3 usage challenge** for hands-on reinforcement.

### Load Balancing, Auto Scaling & Resilience
- Designed a **scalable architecture** using:
  - **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**
  - **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**
- Implemented **Route 53 failover routing** to improve high availability.

### Serverless (AWS Lambda)
- Created and tested **AWS Lambda** functions.
- Explored event-driven computing with **Lambda triggers**.
- Completed a **Lambda challenge** to solve logic-based automation tasks.

### Storage & EBS Volumes
- Worked with **Amazon EBS** volumes (attach/detach/snapshot).
- Explored **storage management** and optimization strategies.

### Monitoring & Logging
- Enabled and interpreted data from:
  - **Amazon CloudWatch** (metrics, dashboards, alarms)
  - **AWS CloudTrail** (event history and user actions)
- Identified performance bottlenecks and system health issues.

### Infrastructure as Code & Automation
- Deployed infrastructure using **AWS CloudFormation templates**.
- Troubleshooted CloudFormation stack errors and rollback events.
- Applied **resource tagging** for governance and cost tracking.
